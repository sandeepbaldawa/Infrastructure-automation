- Start tasks stepwise and ignore or run task selectively..
ansible-playbook script.yml --step

- Run only a specific task
ansible-playbook script.yml --list-tasks
ansible-playbook script.yml --start-at-task=my_task

- Retry script only for the failed set of hosts and not for all (very useful in ennvironment with large no of hosts)
Only failure a script.try is generated and one can just run that which contains name of the host that failed..
i.e. ansible-playbook script.retry

- Static check for a playbook syntax
ansible-playbook --syntax-check script.yml

- Synamic run time check for a playbook
ansible-playbook --check script.yml 
Actually runs the scripts but in a stub way(not actually running the script, but running as an empty stub),
